# Car Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a vehicle dataset to understand the relationship between **performance, pricing, and efficiency**.  
The analysis focuses on uncovering correlations between drivetrain, transmission, engine specifications, horsepower, and pricing â€” with additional attention to EV efficiency and trade-offs between cost and performance.

## Key Objectives
- Clean and prepare raw vehicle data for analysis.
- Explore distributions and trends of key variables (MSRP, horsepower, MPG, drivetrain, etc.).
- Identify **correlations** between specifications and pricing.
- Evaluate **trade-offs** between performance and fuel economy.
- Visualize results clearly for stakeholder decision-making.

## Dataset
- Source: Vehicle dataset provided during Masterschool training.  
- Features include: MSRP (price), engine specs, cylinders, driven wheels, fuel efficiency, size class, etc.  
- Data cleaning steps included handling missing values, ensuring correct data types, and feature selection.

## Methodology
- **Data Wrangling**: Pandas for cleaning and transformation.  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib & Seaborn for histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps, and scatter plots.  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation analysis of pricing vs. performance variables.  
- **Insights**: Focus on EV fuel efficiency, horsepower vs. MSRP, drivetrain/size impact.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- SQL (supporting queries for structured analysis)  
- Tableau (for optional dashboards)
